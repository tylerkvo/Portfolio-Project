                    I am a third year student studying Computer Science and Commerce, with a concentration in Information Technology. Coming to UVA for McIntire, it wasn't until after taking a CS course that I became passionate about technology. I am interested in consulting, business analysis, product management, SWE â€“ somewhere I can leverage my technical skills to create value or develop business solutions.
