                    I am a recent graduate from the University of Virginia where I studied Computer Science and Commerce, with a concentration in Information Technology. With a passion for technology and love for creation and continuous improvement, I spend much of my free time familiarizing myself with different languages and working on projects where I apply the skills I have learned. From developing mobile apps and designing video games to producing travel vlogs, I deeply cherish the entire creative process and strive to enhance each project with every iteration. I am interested in product management, consulting, business analysis, software development â€“ somewhere I can leverage my technical skills to create value or develop business solutions.
